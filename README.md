# Project Explanation

This project is an SSE (Server-Sent Events) example that demonstrates how to implement real-time communication between a server and a client using SSE technology.

## Overview

The SSE technology allows the server to push updates to the client over a single HTTP connection. This eliminates the need for the client to continuously poll the server for updates, resulting in a more efficient and responsive communication channel.

## Features

- Real-time updates: The server can send real-time updates to the client without the need for the client to request them.
- Event-driven architecture: The server can send different types of events to the client, allowing for flexible and customized communication.
- Cross-platform compatibility: SSE is supported by most modern web browsers, making it a reliable choice for real-time communication.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the server using `npm run dev`.
4. Open the client application in your web browser.

## Usage

Once the server and client are running, you can perform the following actions:

- Send messages: The client can send messages to the server, which will be broadcasted to all connected clients.
- Receive updates: The client will receive real-time updates from the server whenever new events occur.
